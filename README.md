MinecraftUUIDfinderNET
======================

A badly (but quickly) coded Minecraft UUID finder using .NET 4. License: MIT, except for any logos, which are copyright to me, and may not be used elsewhere.

Requires NuGet to be installed, as this uses NuGet's restore packaged feature for Json.NET 4.5.11.
